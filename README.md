# DA2-Final-Project
Initially, our team imported the libraries necessary for loading the data, including Polars (pl), NumPy (np), Pandas (pd), LightGBM (lgb), and functions from scikit-learn (sklearn). Each of these libraries/packages plays a crucial role in the data science and machine learning ecosystem, offering distinct functionalities and advantages. Polars (pl) stands out for its efficient DataFrame operations, catering to scenarios where handling large datasets is a priority. NumPy (np) serves as the backbone of numerical computing in Python, providing support for multidimensional arrays and mathematical operations. Pandas (pd) is renowned for its versatility in data manipulation and analysis, offering intuitive data structures like DataFrame and Series. LightGBM (lgb) shines as a high-performance gradient boosting framework, ideal for tasks like classification and regression, especially when efficiency and scalability are paramount. Finally, functions from scikit-learn (sklearn) provide a comprehensive suite of tools for machine learning tasks, covering everything from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment. Together, these libraries empower data scientists and machine learning practitioners with the tools they need to tackle diverse challenges in data analysis and predictive modeling.
